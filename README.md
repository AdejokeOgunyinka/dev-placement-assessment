### Technologies used in the project:
* Reactjs was the frontend framework used for this project, which included installing a couple of packages e.g
+ react-icons: for the icons 
+ react-router-dom: to enable routing when the buttons for either male, female or all users were clicked.
+ react-switch: to design the "Show country" switch
+ react-select-country-list: to design the dropdown of list of countries
+ styled-components: to style the elements in the react app
+ react-csv: for converting JSON data to CSV.

* Javascript Fetch was used to get the data from the Random User API.


### How to test the implementation
* Run yarn install to get the required packages for this project.
* Run yarn start to begin to development server

### Additional Information
I componentized the project so that I could just plug in the different designed parts to where they were needed. I also limited my work to the main branch.
