### Technologies used in the project:
I made use of Reactjs as the framework for this project, which included installing a couple of packages e.g
+ react-icons: for the icons 
+ react-router-dom: to enable routing when the buttons for either male, female or all users were clicked.
+ react-switch: to design the "Show country" switch
+ react-select-country-list: to design the dropdown of list of countries
+ styled-components: to style the elements in the react app
+ react-csv: for converting JSON data to CSV.

I used Javascript Fetch to get the data from the Random User API.

### Additional Information
I componentized the project so that I could just plug in the different designed parts. I also limited my work to the main branch.
